Petr Fiala is a big supporter of Ukraine in its conflict with Russia. The War in Ukraine is a conflict that began on February 24, 2022, with a large-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops in an attempt to take control of the country. Ukraine managed to successfully defend itself and partially push the Russian army back. Many European countries and the US have condemned the Russian attack and are helping Ukraine with the import of weapons, humanitarian aid and also with accepting many refugees from Ukraine. Many economic sanctions have been imposed on Russia. Russia is also waging hybrid warfare by spreading misinformation and lies through social media. Russian aggression convinced neutral countries like Finland and Sweden to join NATO. President Zelenensky has been the president of Ukraine since the beginning of the war. Russia is lead by Vladimir Putin. Petr Fiala is glad that European countries aid and support Ukraine, but says that EU does not send enough weapons for a succesful counter offensive.

He is a supporter of increasing the budget of the army and the Ministry of Defense. New F-35 fighter jets were purchased during his administration and while Fiala is aware of the huge budget deficits of the government, caused by Andrej Babiš, he asserts that national security is a priority.
