The war in Ukraine is a conflict that began on February 24, 2022 with a large-scale invasion of Russian troops into Ukraine in an attempt to take control of the country within a few days. Ukraine successfully defended itself and partially pushed back the Russian army. Many European countries and the US condemned the Russian military attack and they are helping Ukraine with arms import, humanitarian aid and also accepting many refugees from Ukraine. Many economic sanctions have been imposed on Russia. Russia is also waging a hybrid war by spreading lies on the Internet through social networks, especially in the Central Europe region. Russian aggression has convinced neutral countries like Finland and Sweden to join NATO. Ukraine has been led in the war from the beginning by President Zelenensky. On the other side was Russian President Vladimir Putin. Both Russian and Ukrainian forces created a series of trench lines to defend the captured territories, which meant slowing down the offensive. Although President Zelenskyy shows his gratitude to the Western countries, he keeps saying that Ukraine receives only enough weapons to defend itself, but not enough to defeat Russia. The Western world is afraid of the nuclear weapons that Russia possesses. Prime Minister Petr Fiala approves the aid that is being sent to Ukraine. He was one of the first European politicians to visit President Zelensky in Kyiv, Ukraine. The current Czech government is still one of the most pro-Ukrainian and anti-Russian governments in the world, although the popularity of supporting Ukraine in society is declining.
